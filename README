Takes options on stdin and makes a tournament-style ladder out of them.
Then it goes around and asks the user who wins.

I'll have a few choices:
Left - Left one wins
Right - Right one wins
None - Neither move on

The main point of this is that I'm bad at making decisions, and picking one item from a list is hard.
